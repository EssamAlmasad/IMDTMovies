Introduction
In this project we will investigate the IMDB dataset to find the relationships & to see if the movie industry have been improving throughout the years or was the old era of movies better.

In Quastion 1, part 1(The most profitable years in movies industry):
- New movies clearly are more profitable(the late 90s thoughout the 2000s to the 2010s)
- New movies spent more in budgets.
- Movie profits grew substaintially in 55 years between (1960 to 2015) from 1 billion dollars to 10 billion dollars.
- Aside from the revenue growth for the new movies, also the number of movies produced was expodantially increaing in the latest years of movie industry
In Quastion 1, part 2(The highest rating years in movie industry):
- Old movies got higher rating average espcially the 70s & 60s movies.
- The number of movies produced in the 70s & 60s movies was very low comparing to the latest years.
- The AVG was hovering in 6 out of 10 at best 1973 6.7/10.
- The highest movie year in average ratings was 1973 with only 55 movies produced, and the lowest year in average rating was 2012 with 588 movies produced.
In Quastion 2 (The relationship between revenue and rating):
- Higher vote ratings compliment higher revenues.
- Many movies with revenue over 1 billion dollars can get over 7 out of 10.
- Many movies with revenue less than 1 billion dollars hovering between 5 & 8 out of 10.
Limitations
there were some limitations of this dataset:
- Many NAN (null) values.
- Many zero values of budget & revenue.
- very difficult to manipulate text or string values.
